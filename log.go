	// N.B. It is _up to the client_ to handle upgrade paths. For instance if
	// using this with go-raftchunking, the client should ensure that all Raft
	// peers are using a version that can handle that extension before ever
	// actually triggering chunking behavior. It is sometimes sufficient to
	// ensure that non-leaders are upgraded first, then the current leader is
	// upgraded, but a leader changeover during this process could lead to
	// trouble, so gating extension behavior via some flag in the client
	// program is also a good idea.
